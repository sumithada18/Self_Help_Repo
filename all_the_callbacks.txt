Okay, here's a comparison table for function pointers, functors, and lambdas, focusing on their characteristics and best use cases:

Feature	                          Function Pointer	                  Functor (Function Object)	                      Lambda Expression (C++11+)
What is it?	        Pointer to a function's address        	An object of a class that overloads operator()	        Anonymous, inline function

Stateful?          	No (cannot easily hold state)	        Yes (can have member variables)	                          Yes (can capture variables by value or reference)

Syntax	            ret_type (*name)(args)              	class MyFunctor { ret_type operator()(args) {...} };	  [captures](args) -> ret_type {body}

Inline-ability	    Less likely to be inlined by 	        Good, like any normal method call	                         Excellent, often inlined easily
                    compiler (due to indirection)
Type Safety	        Signature must match, but less C++   	Strong (it's a class)	                                   Strong (compiler generates a unique type)
                    "type system" integration
Ease of Use      	Can be verbose, typedef helps          	Requires defining a class	                                Often very concise for simple tasks

Flexibility      	Limited (just calls a function)	        High (full class capabilities)	                          High (captures, can be generic)

Overhead	        Minimal (pointer dereference)	          Similar to a normal method call                          	Can be very low, often no overhead vs. handwritten code

Compatibility	      Excellent with C APIs	                C++ only	                                                  C++11 onwards only


When to Use What / Best Use Cases:

Scenario / Use Case	                Best Choice(s)	                           Why?	                                        When Not to Use (or less ideal)
Interfacing with C                 Function Pointer	                      C understands function                	      Functors, Lambdas (directly)
APIs / Callbacks to                                                       pointers directly.
C code	 

Simple, stateless callback         Lambda(if C++11+), 	                  Lambdas are concise.                          Function pointers are simple if no state needed.	Functor (might be overkill)
needed quickly	                   Function Pointer

Callback needing to 	             Functor, Lambda (with captures)        Functors have members,	                      Function Pointer (needs workarounds like void* context)
maintain state                                                            Lambdas can capture.

Defining a "strategy" or           Functor	                              Natural fit for                               Function Pointer
behavior with state                                                       encapsulating behavior + data.

Passing custom comparison 	       Lambda, Functor                     	  Lambdas are often most convenient.            Functors are also good.	Function Pointer (can be done, but more verbose)
to std::sort, etc.

Short, one-off operations          Lambda	                                Designed for this; 	                          Functor (class definition overhead), Function Pointer
inline (e.g., in algorithms)	     highly readable and concise.

Need to be stored 	               All three (Lambdas &	                  std::function can wrap any callable.                	-
in std::function                   Functors are most common)

Creating a family of related, 	   Functor 	                              Class structure allows for this.	            Lambda (less structured for families), Function Pointer
stateful operations                (potentially with inheritance)

Maximal performance for            Lambda, Functor	                      Compilers are often very                       Function Pointer (indirection might hinder inlining)
a tiny operation where                                                    good at inlining these.
inlining is critical	

Pre-C++11 code where 	              Functor	                              Lambdas weren't available.	                   Lambda
stateful callables are 
needed

In Simple Terms - Which is "Best"?
 - For C interop or very simple stateless callbacks: Function Pointers are fine.
 - For most modern C++ inline callbacks, especially with standard algorithms: Lambdas are often the most convenient, readable, and efficient.
 - When you need a callable object that explicitly manages significant state or complex logic as part of a well-defined 
   "behavioral object": Functors provide a clear class-based structure.

The "best" choice depends heavily on the specific context, required C++ version, and whether state needs to be associated with the callable.
Modern C++ leans heavily towards lambdas for their conciseness and power, with functors still valuable for more structured stateful callables.
